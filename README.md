# car_insurance_prediction
Classification project on car insurance prediction.

# Overview
This repository contains code and data for a car insurance prediction project. The project aims to predict customer behavior in purchasing car insurance based on various features. It explores two different machine learning models, Ridge Classifier and Lasso Regression, for this predictive task. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction on live data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about 4,000 customers with 19 different features. There is also a separate dataset for live data prediction containing 1,000 customers. Both datasets have undergone thorough preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
2. Model Building: Implementing two different models, Ridge Classifier and Lasso Regression, for car insurance prediction.
3. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
4. Prediction on Live Data: Making predictions on a separate live data set and exporting the results.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Akash-111196/car_insurance_prediction.git
2. Set up your Python environment with the required libraries.
3. Explore and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository.
4. Train and evaluate the models on the training data.
5. Predict car insurance purchases on live data using the trained models.

# Models Used

# Ridge Classifier
1. Utilizes Ridge Classifier for car insurance prediction.
2. Features are selected based on their coefficients.
# Lasso Regression
1. Implements Lasso Regression with feature selection based on coefficients.
2. Uses a threshold to classify car insurance purchases.

# Model Performance
Both models are evaluated on the provided test dataset, and their classification performance is reported in the classification reports available in the repository. You can choose the model that best fits your specific prediction needs.

# Live Data Prediction
The repository includes code to make predictions on live data. This enables you to apply the trained models to new data and make predictions about car insurance purchases.
